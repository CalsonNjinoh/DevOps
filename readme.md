How many s3 bucket did u calculate and how 

ChatGPT
For the S3 bucket calculation, I used the details you provided:

Details:
Number of S3 Buckets: 25
Average Storage per Bucket: 150 MB (0.15 GB)
Calculation:
Total Storage:

Total storage = Number of buckets * Average storage per bucket
Total storage = 25 buckets * 0.15 GB = 3.75 GB
Cost Calculation:

Storage Cost: $0.023 per GB per month
Monthly Cost = Total storage * Storage cost per GB
Monthly Cost = 3.75 GB * $0.023/GB = $0.08625
Summary of the Calculation:
Item	Value
Number of Buckets	25
Average Storage	150 MB per bucket (0.15 GB)
Total Storage	3.75 GB
Cost per GB	$0.023
Monthly Cost	$0.08625
This calculation assumes that the storage usage and costs are constant, and it doesn't include additional costs for requests, data retrieval, or transfer out of S3, which might be relevant depending on your application's usage patterns.

We are charge for cloud trail for data event trailing 

ChatGPT
CloudTrail Data Event Pricing
Amazon CloudTrail charges for data events, which track specific operations on S3 objects or Lambda functions. These charges are separate from the free tier for management events.

Pricing Details:
Data Events for S3: $0.10 per 100,000 events
Data Events for Lambda: $0.20 per 100,000 events
Estimation Approach:
Assume:

S3 Data Events: Estimated 500,000 events per month
Lambda Data Events: Estimated 200,000 events per month
Cost Calculation:
S3 Data Events:

Monthly Cost = (500,000 events / 100,000) * $0.10
Monthly Cost = 5 * $0.10 = $0.50
Lambda Data Events:

Monthly Cost = (200,000 events / 100,000) * $0.20
Monthly Cost = 2 * $0.20 = $0.40
Total Monthly Cost for CloudTrail Data Events:
Total Cost: $0.50 (S3) + $0.40 (Lambda) = $0.90
