Jenkins Upgrade Guide

Purpose

This guide provides detailed instructions for upgrading Jenkins on an Ubuntu server. The upgrade process involves backing up the existing Jenkins WAR file, stopping the Jenkins service, applying the upgrade, and then restarting the service. This guide is designed to ensure a smooth upgrade with minimal downtime.

Navigate to the Jenkins web interface.
Go to Manage Jenkins â†’ System Information.
Find the executable-war property to see the path of the jenkins.war file.

```bash
copy code
sudo cp /usr/share/java/jenkins.war /path/to/backup/location/
