Jenkins Upgrade Guide

Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions to upgrade Jenkins on an Ubuntu server. Before proceeding with the upgrade, it is crucial to backup the current Jenkins installation and ensure minimal downtime.

Prerequisites

Administrative access to the Ubuntu server running Jenkins.
Access to the Jenkins web interface.
Backup Jenkins WAR File

The jenkins.war file contains the core Jenkins application. It is essential to backup this file before upgrading.

Locating the jenkins.war File
Find jenkins.war Path in Jenkins UI:
Navigate to your Jenkins web interface.
Go to Manage Jenkins â†’ System Information.
Look for the executable-war property. This property shows the path of the jenkins.war file, typically /usr/share/java/jenkins.war.
Backup the WAR File
Backup jenkins.war via Terminal:
Connect to your server via SSH.
Run the following command to copy the jenkins.war file to a backup location:
bash
Copy code
sudo cp /usr/share/java/jenkins.war /path/to/backup/location/

Post-Upgrade Steps

Verify Upgrade
Check Jenkins Version:
After restarting, verify the upgrade by logging into the Jenkins UI and checking the version number.
Delete Old WAR File

Rollback Plan

In case of any issues post-upgrade:

Stop Jenkins service.
Restore the original jenkins.war file from your backup.
Start Jenkins service.
Remember to replace /path/to/backup/location/ with the actual path where you want to store your backups. Also, ensure that you have tested this process in a staging environment before applying it to a production server.
