## Master Account:
This is your AWS Organizations' root account.
It's recommended that you avoid deploying any workloads in the master account. Instead, use it primarily for billing and management purposes.

## Organizational Units (OUs):

Based on environments:

## Core Services: 
For shared services that other accounts or environments might depend on. E.g., shared networking resources, central logging, etc.
## Production: 
For all your production workloads.

## Development: 
For all your development workloads.

## Staging: 
For your staging or pre-production workloads.

## Security: 
For logging, monitoring, and security services such as CloudTrail, AWS Config, and GuardDuty.
## Sandbox: 
For experimentation or personal projects. This gives your team a place to test and experiment without affecting other environments.


## Individual Accounts:
These should fall under the respective OUs:

## Log Archive Account (Under Security): 
Where all CloudTrail and other logs are aggregated.
## Audit Account (Under Security): 
For auditors to access and assess AWS resources without affecting the live environment.
## Shared Services Account (Under Core Services): 
Where shared resources are deployed.
And individual accounts for various departments, projects, or teams as required.

## Service Control Policies (SCPs):
After creating the hierarchy, implement SCPs to enforce central policies at the OU or individual account level. For example, you can restrict certain AWS services from being used in the Development OU to manage costs.

# SLIDE 2 CHALLENGES OF CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE 

## 1) Lack of Isolation:

## Description: 
Combining production, development, and staging within a single account lacks the necessary isolation that different environments require.

## Impact: 
An inadvertent change or error in the development environment could potentially affect production, leading to outages or disruptions.

##  2) Security Concerns:
## Description: 
Sharing a single account across different workloads can lead to insufficient or overly permissive access controls.

## Impact: 
This increases the risk of unauthorized access, potential data breaches, or unintended changes.

## 3) Billing Complexity:
## Description: 
With all workloads under a single account, it's challenging to allocate costs to specific projects, teams, or departments.
## Impact: 
This complicates cost tracking, budgeting, and chargebacks.

## 4) Operational Overhead:

## Description: 
Management tasks such as patching, backups, and monitoring become intertwined across environments, making routine operations more complex.
## Impact: 
Increased risk of operational mistakes and higher time investments for tasks that should be straightforward.

## 5) Limitations on Resource Policies:
Description: With all workloads in one account, crafting IAM policies and resource-specific controls that cater to the nuances of each environment becomes challenging.

## Impact: 
Potential over-permissiveness or overly restrictive policies, leading to either security risks or hampered productivity.

## 6) Scalability Issues:
## Description: 
As your organization grows and introduces more workloads, the existing structure will become even more challenging to manage and scale.

## Impact: 
Future growth may be hampered by the foundational inefficiencies of the current setup.

## 7) Cross-Environment Interference:
## Description: 
Shared resources between environments, like compute limits or service quotas, could lead to resource contention.
## Impact: 
Unexpected outages in development could have cascading effects on staging or even production.

## 7) Delayed Onboarding: 
Prolonged access granting for new employees due to combined production and development environments
## Impact 
less productivity
