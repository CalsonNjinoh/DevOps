Achieving the resiliency testing as described requires a structured approach, integrating AWS services and implementing best practices within your development and operational processes. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. Understand RTO and RPO
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum acceptable time your application can be offline.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
These metrics should be defined based on the criticality of your application and its data.

2. Periodic and Event-Triggered Resiliency Testing
Schedule Regular Tests: Conduct resiliency testing at least every 12 months, or more frequently based on your organization's requirements and the criticality of the application.
Test After Major Updates: Any significant change to the application or its infrastructure should trigger a resiliency test to ensure that the modifications haven't adversely affected your resilience posture.
3. Scope of Resiliency Testing
Accidental Data Loss: Simulate scenarios where data might be lost, intentionally or accidentally, and test the recovery processes.
Instance Failures: Simulate failures of individual instances within your environment to ensure that the application can withstand and recover from such failures.
Availability Zone Failures: Test the application's ability to continue operations in the event of a complete Availability Zone failure in AWS. This involves ensuring that your application can failover to another AZ without significant downtime or data loss.
4. Utilize AWS Resilience Hub and AWS FIS
AWS Resilience Hub: Use this service to assess and improve the resilience of your applications by identifying potential weaknesses and implementing recommended practices. It provides a central place to define and manage resilience goals and requirements.
AWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS): Integrate this service for chaos engineering by injecting faults and simulating real-world incidents. This helps validate your application's behavior under adverse conditions and ensures that it meets RTO and RPO targets.
5. Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines
Automate Resilience Testing: Leverage the API operations provided by AWS Resilience Hub to integrate resilience assessment and testing directly into your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This ensures ongoing validation of your application’s resilience as part of the development lifecycle.
Continuous Resilience Validation: This integration helps ensure that any change to your application or infrastructure doesn’t compromise its ability to meet defined RTO and RPO objectives.
6. Achieve FTR Approval
Document and Review: Ensure that at least one resilience test that meets the RTO and RPO requirements is completed and documented prior to Final Technical Review (FTR) approval. This documentation should be reviewed by stakeholders and used to make informed decisions about the application's readiness.
Implementation Steps
Assessment: Begin with assessing your current resilience posture using AWS Resilience Hub.
Planning: Based on the assessment, plan your resilience strategies and define RTO and RPO for your applications.
Integration: Integrate AWS Resilience Hub and AWS FIS into your development and operational processes, including CI/CD pipelines.
Testing: Conduct regular and event-triggered resiliency tests, using AWS FIS to simulate various failure scenarios.
Evaluation: After testing, evaluate if the application meets the RTO and RPO objectives. Adjust your resilience strategies as necessary.
Documentation: Document all tests, outcomes, and adjustments. This documentation is crucial for FTR approval.
By following these steps and utilizing AWS's tools, you can ensure that your application is resilient and meets its defined RTO and RPO targets, maintaining high availability and minimizing data loss even in adverse scenarios.
